/**
    An "Exit" acts to remove an Entry.  After seeing an Exit pointing to
    an Entry, the system should act as though that Entry no longer exists.
    An expiry set on an Exit makes this removal temporary.  One use case is
    to temporarily remove an item from a work queue to start processing it,
    then permanently remove it once processing has been completed.
    To remove keys from a schema, adding a new Entry with deleting=True 
    is generally better (otherwise prior Entries with earlier timestamps
    will appear to be in effect).
